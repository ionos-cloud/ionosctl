# DnsRecordDelete

## Usage

```text
ionosctl dns record delete [flags]
```

## Aliases

For `record` command:

```text
[r]
```

For `delete` command:

```text
[del d]
```

## Description

To delete a specific record from a specific zone:
ionosctl dns r del --zone ZONE --record RECORD
Here, ZONE is the ID or name of the DNS zone from where you want to delete a record, and RECORD is the ID or full name of the DNS record you want to delete.

To delete all records, optionally filtering by partial name and zone:
ionosctl dns r delete --all [--record PARTIAL_NAME] [--zone ZONE]
Here, --all deletes all DNS records. You can also filter the records to delete by providing a PARTIAL_NAME that matches part of the name of the records you want to delete. Additionally, you can specify a ZONE to restrict the deletion to a specific DNS zone.

To delete a record by partial name, specifying the zone:
ionosctl dns r delete --record PARTIAL_NAME --zone ZONE
Here, PARTIAL_NAME is a part of the name of the DNS record you want to delete. If multiple records match the partial name, an error will be thrown: you will need to narrow down to a single record

## Options

```text
  -a, --all              Delete all records. You can optionally filter the deleted records using --zone (full name / ID) and --record (partial name)
  -u, --api-url string   Override default host url (default "dns.de-fra.ionos.com")
      --cols strings     Set of columns to be printed on output 
                         Available columns: [Id Name Content Type Enabled FQDN State ZoneId ZoneName]
  -c, --config string    Configuration file used for authentication (default "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ionosctl/config.json")
  -f, --force            Skip yes/no confirmation
  -h, --help             Print usage
      --no-headers       When using text output, don't print headers
  -o, --output string    Desired output format [text|json] (default "text")
  -q, --quiet            Quiet output
  -r, --record string    The ID, or full name of the DNS record. Required together with --zone. Can also provide partial names, but must narrow down to a single record result if not using --all. If using it, will however delete all records that match.
  -v, --verbose          Print step-by-step process when running command
  -z, --zone string      The full name or ID of the zone of the containing the target record. If --all is set this is applied as a filter - limiting to records within this zone
```

## Examples

```text
ionosctl dns r del --zone ZONE --record RECORD
ionosctl dns r delete --all [--record PARTIAL_NAME] [--zone ZONE]
ionosctl dns r delete --record PARTIAL_NAME --zone ZONE
```
